🚀 **Ghost Stage** is a lightweight VS Code extension that **automatically stages new files in Git** as soon as they are created.  
No need to manually run `git add` in the terminal—just create a file, and it will instantly appear in the **staged changes** of Source Control.

## ✨ Features
- 📌 **Auto-stage new files** as soon as they are created.
- 🖥️ **Instant Git refresh**, so staged files immediately appear in VS Code's Source Control.
- 🔔 **Clear notifications** when files are staged.
- ⚡ **No setup required**, just install and go.
